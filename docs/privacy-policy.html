    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">GeoLinkPinPoint &mdash; Effective February 6, 2026</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        GeoLinkPinPoint is a native Android utility app developed by Michael Nawrocki.
        This policy explains how the app handles your data.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Collected</h2>
    <p>The app accesses the following data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Precise location (GPS coordinates)</strong> &mdash; used to display your current position and to calculate distance and bearing between two points.</li>
        <li><strong>Device sensors (accelerometer and magnetometer)</strong> &mdash; used to display a compass heading.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Data Is Stored</h2>
    <p>
        All data is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> in a Room database.
        No data is transmitted to any server, cloud service, or third party.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        The app does not include any analytics, advertising, crash reporting,
        or other third-party SDKs. No data is shared with third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>CSV Export</h2>
    <p>
        You can export saved measurements as a CSV file via Android's share sheet.
        This action is entirely user-initiated. The exported file is shared only
        with the app or service you choose in the share sheet.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>
        You can delete individual measurements by swiping them in the History tab.
        Uninstalling the app removes all stored data from your device.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        The app does not knowingly collect data from children under 13.
        It does not require account creation or collect personal information
        beyond device location.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        Any updates to this policy will be posted on this page with a revised
        effective date.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
