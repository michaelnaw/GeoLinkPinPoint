GeoLinkPinPoint is a field utility for capturing GPS coordinates from WhatsApp shared locations and calculating distance and bearing between two points.

<b>How it works</b>
Tap a shared location in WhatsApp (or any app that uses geo: links) and choose GeoLinkPinPoint. The coordinates auto-fill as Point A. Repeat with a second location for Point B. Distance and bearing are calculated instantly.

<b>Key features</b>
- <b>WhatsApp integration</b> — Registers as a geo: URI handler so shared locations open directly in the app
- <b>Distance and bearing</b> — Haversine distance (meters/km) and forward bearing (degrees + cardinal direction)
- <b>Manual coordinate input</b> — Enter lat/lng by hand or use "Use Current Location" with GPS
- <b>Live GPS display</b> — Shows current latitude, longitude, altitude, and accuracy
- <b>Compass</b> — Smooth sensor-fused compass with bearing-to-target indicator
- <b>Measurement history</b> — Save measurements to a local database, tap to reload, swipe to delete
- <b>CSV export</b> — Share your measurement history as a CSV file via the share sheet

<b>Privacy first</b>
All data stays on your device. No accounts, no analytics, no ads, no cloud sync. Your location data is never sent anywhere.

<b>Requirements</b>
Android 8.0 or newer. Location permission required for GPS features.
